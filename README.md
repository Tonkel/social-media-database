# social-media-database

## Description
This application I created is a backend application which allows you to connect to your mongo db database and submit, update, and delete data from it using the api routes I created. You will be able to create users, thoughts and reactions. You will be able to relate thoughts to users, and reactions to thoughts. Make sure you have MongoDB compass installed so you can easily view what is in your database in realtime. Below, I will include a link to a video which shows me walking through each route. Take a look at the models when creating/updating thouhgts and users so you know how to format your json input.
